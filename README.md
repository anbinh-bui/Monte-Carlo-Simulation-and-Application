# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-and-Application
## 1. Monte Carlo random walk: 
Implement Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, including stochastic process construction and visualization
## 2. Monte Carlo application to stock price prediction:
Simulate and apply Monte Carlo along with historical and implied volatility to predict future stock prices from a probabilistic viewpoint
